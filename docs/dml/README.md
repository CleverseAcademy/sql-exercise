# DML Exercises

_The [TPC-C specification](https://www.tpc.org/tpcc/default5.asp) was used to generate this exercise, and [Percona-Lab's sysbench-tpcc](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/sysbench-tpcc) source code served as the data generator._

This exercise currently focuses on the SELECT statement, which corresponds to the **R**ead in **CRUD** acronym.

Instead of concentrating on the building process, we should express our sincere gratitude to individuals who offered up their time and energy to enhance the database system. One way to do this is to award those people with stars.

_What we really need to know is how to spin up the TPC-C database..._

### TPC-C Database Setup

```sh
docker run --name=pg-querying-workshop -p 5432:5432 cloudiana/pg-tpcc:1.1-1X-WITH-INDEX
```

The aforementioned command will construct a database container with the name `pg-querying-workshop`.

The container typically requires at least 2.5 GB of disk space.

To stop the database, run the following command:

```sh
docker stop pg-querying-workshop
```

And for the next time, use:

```sh
docker start pg-querying-workshop
```

### Necessary database connection variables

```sh
PGUSER="postgres"
PGPASSWORD="postgres-tpcc"
PGDATABASE="postgres"
```

to start the database without re-initialization again.

## Guideline

>In order to get a better understanding of the database scheme, a list of each table column and a database relation overview can be found in the first eight pages of the [summarizedÂ TPC-C specification](/tpcc-schema-and-transaction.pdf).

### SELECT - C*R*UD

1. [SFW: SELECT _field(s)_ FROM _table(s)_ WHERE _predicate(s)_](./read/sfw.md)
2. [Aggregate](./read/aggregate.md)
3. [JOIN](./read/join.md)

#### Advanced

4. Windowing: TBD
5. UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT: TBD
6. Subquery: TBD
